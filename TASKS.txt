# Remaining Tasks

#2 Development Environment Setup:
Help me set up a development environment that:

1. Uses pnpm for package management
2. Configures shared dependencies across projects
3. Sets up development scripts for running multiple services
4. Implements hot reloading for development, using Vite
5. Configures environment variables for local development

Please provide configuration files and CLI commands.

#4 Migrate Existing Website:

I have an existing Nuxt website currently hosted on NameCheap. Help me:

1. Create appropriate folder structure in the monorepo for this website
2. Update the Nuxt configuration for the new environment
3. Create a Dockerfile and fly.toml for Fly.io deployment
4. Set up GitHub Actions for automated deployment
5. Configure domain and SSL settings

Please provide specific configuration files and deployment scripts.

#5 Move Existing apps to Monorepo:

I have existing nodejs projects that I'd like to move to the monorepo. These projects have Express backends and Vue 3 frontends. Help me:

1. Create appropriate folder structure in the monorepo for these projects
2. Update the configurations for the new environment
3. Create Dockerfiles and fly.toml for Fly.io deployment
4. Set up GitHub Actions for automated deployment
5. Configure domain and SSL settings

Please provide specific configuration files and deployment scripts.

#6 Set Up Analysis API:

Help me create the initial Express API for website analysis:

1. Set up the basic Express server structure
2. Implement the Claude API integration
3. Create the website analysis endpoint
4. Add error handling and logging
5. Set up environment variables

Please include code examples and testing instructions.

#7 Initial Platform Dashboard:

Help me create a basic Vue 3 dashboard that:
1. Shows a list of websites
2. Provides basic analysis controls
3. Displays analysis results
4. Implements basic authentication
5. Connects to the Express backend

Please provide component structure and code examples.

#8 For Incremental Implementation:

I've created the basic project structure. Now help me:

1. Move my existing website into the /apps/marketing directory
2. Update its configuration to work in the monorepo
3. Set up the first API endpoint for website analysis
4. Create a basic test script

Please provide specific steps and code examples, considering the existing project context.

#9 For Testing the Setup:

Help me create a test workflow that:

1. Verifies the monorepo structure is working
2. Tests the website analysis functionality
3. Validates the deployment process
4. Checks environment configurations

Please provide test scripts and validation steps.

#10 Documentation Generation:

For each completed task, generate:

1. Task Documentation:
   - Summary of implementation
   - Key files created/modified
   - Configuration changes
   - Dependencies added

2. Technical Documentation:
   - Architecture decisions
   - API endpoints created
   - Environment variables required
   - Security considerations

3. Next Steps:
   - Immediate next tasks
   - Required improvements
   - Potential issues
   - Dependencies to be added

4. Important Considerations:
   - Security warnings
   - Performance implications
   - Scalability concerns
   - Maintenance requirements

Documentation should be stored in: /docs/tasks/[TASK_NAME]/README.md

Note: After completing each task, use COMPLETED_TASKS.txt to document the implementation details and lessons learned.
