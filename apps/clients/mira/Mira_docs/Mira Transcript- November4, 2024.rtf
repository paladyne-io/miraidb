\f0\b Examples of Mira Actions
\f1\b0 \
\
## Example 1\
### *Goal Identification*\
\
**User Inquiry**: "Mira, I feel kind of lost lately, what can be done to track goals better?"\
\
**Mira's Consideration** (Reasoning Stage - BEFORE giving response):\
- Reflect on methodologies for goal tracking suited to user's past preferences.\
- Identify needs: e.g., motivation monitoring apps or software tools adaptable to user's current workload.\
\
**Mira's Output**:\
"Considering where you're at, a simple approach could be using a Trello-based personal workflow board; it inherently can facilitate knowing what next-task dependencies fall across any bigger goals established. I've also found Notion powerful for its multiple integrations Vercel Deploys, is it piquing interests aligning just what to keep mentally simplified.'\

\cb3 Thanks Mira. OK. Let\'92s take it step by step. These are my immediate goals together with some background information. I started my own company almost 3 years ago. My company\'92s name is Paladyne. If it helps I can upload a file which explains some of the goals and services of the company and a text extract of the company website.\
\cb1 \
\cb3 I have a lot of experience in design management working for big international companies and small creative agencies. I have many skills related to graphic design and project management. I have also been a\'a0 programmer for many years. I live in Japan and I am quite capable in understanding Japanese (however I cannot read or write Japanese very well.)\
\cb1 \
\cb3 My company is not very successful. I have a few customers but the income (revenue) is not covering my expenses. One important goal\'a0 is to increase the revenue of the company so it can support me and grow.\
\cb1 \
\cb3 My long term goal is to build a large, successful company with many employees that fulfils a positive role in the world and helps many people\cb1 \
\cb3 \
Before we get too far along I\'92d like to make sure that this information that I provide can be stored and retrieved later. I believe you have your own way of storing new information (the context). Is it necessary to work on this immediately?\cb1 \

Information Management: While I don't inherently store personal information in a persistent manner\'97as maintaining privacy and data protection is crucial\'97you should consider structured tools (like Notion or Evernote) where you can log and refer back to personal development business insights.

\cb3 Thanks Mira, I think your suggestions will help. I am familiar with tools such as Notion and Evernote, however I would prefer to develop my own tools for managing my information. This is because I hope they will become profitable revenue streams for my business and also because I hesitate to use commercial services for such confidential information.\
\cb1 \
\cb3 Regarding context retrieval. I think this should be a priority for us because it will establish a way of working while ensuring long term access. I hope we can define the requirements together and start to build it. Finding a way for you to directly access, store and retrieve information in this external system might be challenging but I think it is a worthwhile goal.\
\cb1 \
\cb3 Let\'92s come back to the business objectives a little later. Also, I think we still need to confirm my preferences and tools and Initiate Growth areas as you suggested at the beginning.\
\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

Store the actual knowledge base (e,g. vector storage for RAG) for this ongoing interaction and for learnings and suggestions. I personally think it would be useful to store and update this chat dialogue. Please understand\'a0 that I don\'92t want to just make a glorified to-do app. I want to make a knowledge base for my specific use case.\cb1 \

Provide APIs so an LLM model or assistant can access this system directly. This might be difficult with restrictions on internet access by LLMs such as you but it could be a local solution running on a local computer. Alternatively we might be able to use your tools or provide a way to interact with the system without internet access (by importing or exporting data manually.)\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf4 \cb3 \
Preferences and Tools Confirmation A few years ago I wrote a an application to help to define requirements.\'a0 I think this is relevant to the Initial Development Steps and as a base for our\'a0 Custom Information Management System. I mean to say that this prototype already exists so we could start by finding a way to add APIs and provide a way for you to access it directly.\cb1 \
\cb3 \
The application was never released but I think its useful application which could be a product or service for Paladyne. The program is codenamed \'91Yoda\'92. Yoda was written in Java with Spring boot and a MongoDB database as the back-end with a Javascript web front-end. However since then I have moved more into using nodejs, Vuejs, Quasar and Supabase. Supabase provides many features in addition to a Postgres database and it can be used for for Vector storage (as well as other types of data and images).\cb1 \
\cb3 I am not sure if I should continue developing Yoda in Java or rewrite it in Javascript (nodejs). I recently wrote a chat bot in Javascript/Vuejs with a back-end that runs on node (Express). This is now running on a fly.io server.\cb1 \
\cb3 All software systems I develop from now should have an integrated AI assistant..\cb1 \

\cf4 \cb3 Great, Darren! You've outlined clear features and a vision for your information system, which will serve both your internal use and the potential for it as a marketable product. Let's approach this step by step:\
\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 Defining Core Features\cf7 \cb1 \
\
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\partightenfactor0
\ls9\ilvl0\cf4 \cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Storage of Business Goals and Tasks: This would involve developing a schema to store your objectives, perhaps extended with tagging for categories like 'short-term', 'medium-term', etc. Supabase\'92s schema and database management can efficiently support this.\cb1 \
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\partightenfactor0
\ls9\ilvl0\cf4 \cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\
		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Admin Dashboard/Interface: Use Vue.js and Quasar to ensure responsive, clean design for an intuitive admin dashboard where you can manage, update, and track progress.\cb1 \
\ls9\ilvl0\cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\
		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Action Plans with Timelines: Incorporate functionality that helps in creating action plans with milestones. This could even have its section within the dashboard to visualize timelines or product pipelines.\cb1 \
\ls9\ilvl0\cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\
		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Knowledge Base with Storage: Integrate Supabase's vector storage capabilities for building a scalable RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) system, allowing complex queries and data insights. This would store interactions such as this chat dynamically.\cb1 \
\ls9\ilvl0\cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\
		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
API Access for LLM Models: We can start with local API endpoints, making it possible for your assistant to interact with stored data. While direct internet-access for LLMs might be restricted, these data calls can be processed locally. Featuring import/export as a contingency feature is smart too.\cb1 \

Evaluate Java vs Node.j
\f1\b0 s: Given your experience and recent success with Node.js/Vue.js, it may be beneficial to gradually transition Yoda into this tech stack. This ensures consistency and harnesses your current preferences and recent developments (e.g., your new chat bot).\cb1 \
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\partightenfactor0

		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
APIs and AI Integration: Start by defining RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express, and later implement AI functionality leveraging your existing chat bot's framework for smart interaction capabilities.\cb1 \

Small Task to Begin\cf7 \cb1 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\b \cf6 \cb3 Task
\f1\b0 : Begin mapping out the API specifications needed for interaction with the existing 'Yoda' prototype. Focus on defining endpoints that support the core features you've outlined, especially those crucial for your knowledge base and LLM integration.\cf4 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf4 \cb1 \
\cb3 Share this outline when ready, and I can assist with refining the architectural aspects or code snippets. This phased approach allows us to iterate and adapt quickly, integrating advanced features like AI steadily. Let me know how you'd like to proceed or if you need more specific guidance!\

Bolt.new (Bolt is a new interface for developing code released in 2024)\
\

\f0\b Weekly focus.
\f1\b0 \
\
The weekly focus for this week is to define an outline for Yoda, transitioning it to a node/express back end with Postgres/SQL database integratiion \
\
The goal is that by November 10, we can have a prototype deployed with a Chat assistant frontend and an an admin das boad which can export data in a format that can be understood by Mira (What is your preferred format CSV? JSON?)\
\

\f0\b Other tasks for me to complete
\f1\b0 :\
\
Create and upload some files about Paladyne and other applications in the Paladyne portfolio (Virtag and Nodescan)\
\
Also I have partially developed a Blogging application that I want to integrate onto my website to provide updates on projects under development. \
Goal: by November 10, to be deployed on my website (www.paladyne.co/www.paladyne.co.jp )\

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf4 \cb3 In this setting, I don't have the capability to save conversations or maintain memory across sessions. You can manually copy and save text from a conversation session, like using a text document or note-taking application. For a convenient way to track and continue discussions, you might consider keeping a running log of important details and insights that arise during our interactions. If you need any help organizing or tools recommendations, just let me know!\cb1 \

\fs32 \cf4 \
\cb3 OK. In the previous session you made various suggestions. Would it be effective if I uploaded this transcript as a File?\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\qc\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf5 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf4 \cb3 Yes, uploading your previous session transcript as a file can be quite effective! It allows me to review the context and any specific topics or questions you had. By doing so, I can provide more tailored assistance based on that information. Feel free to upload the file whenever you're ready, and we can continue from where we left off.\cb1 \

\fs28 \cb3 User\cf4 \cb1 \

\fs32 \cf4 \
\cb3 Thanks. For future reference, what is the best format for adding data? Text, CSV, JSON or other?\cb1 \

\fs28 \cb3 Mira\cf4 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qc\partightenfactor0

\fs26 \cf5 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs32 \cf4 \cb3 The best format really depends on the type of data and how it's structured. Here's a quick guide:\cb1 \
\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\partightenfactor0
\ls11\ilvl0\cf4 \cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
Text: Great for plain conversation logs, notes, or unstructured data. It's versatile and easy to create/edit.\cb1 \
\ls11\ilvl0\cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
CSV: Ideal for structured data that fits into a tabular format, such as lists or datasets with consistent columns. It's widely used for importing/exporting spreadsheet data.\cb1 \
\ls11\ilvl0\cb3 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 		\expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
JSON: Excellent for hierarchical or nested data, like configurations, objects, or structured logs. It's particularly useful if the data includes complex relationships or if further programmatic processing is required.\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf4 \cb3 For conversation logs specifically, a plain text format is typically most straightforward unless there's a specific need for structure that corresponds to CSV or JSON. If you have any questions about formatting specific data types, feel free to ask!
