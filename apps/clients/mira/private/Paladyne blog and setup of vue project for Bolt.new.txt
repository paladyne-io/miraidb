Using Bolt.new (local version)

Name: Simple Blog Frontend with Vue.js

https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77538589/the-cjs-build-of-vites-node-api-is-deprecated

If you use JS, then change the vite.config.js file name to vite.config.mjs
If you use TS, change the file name to vite.config.mts instead of vite.config.ts

Note: Upcoming Supabase changes 
https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/29260

The anon key will be renamed to publishable key and the service_role key will be renamed to secret key. 
publishable api keys are meant to be used along with Supabase Auth users and secret api keys are for use from the server side and bypasses all row level security policies.

Update your .env file to contain the new API key
# the legacy anon key
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...w6PYobnC7Ep7EnDd9DG25qBFDsBGn0iqSmL28Zeg8f0 

# the new publishable key
SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=sb_publishable_123abc
Instantiate the supabase client with the new API Keys.
import { createClient } from 'supabase/supabase-js' 

const supabase = createClient(VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY)

-------------------------------
Stage 2 Prompt

I have completed the Supabase setup. Tables for blog_posts, comments and likes exist. Can you please create a useSupabase composable file with common API functions to create a new blog post, upload and save and retrieve an image for the post, and add comments using the Supabase (v2) backend. Then create a BlogPage.vue file that uses useSupabase composable to use the API to load and add new blog posts. Please use some dummy text to fill out the sample blog posts.

Response:
Let's create a useSupabase composable file with common API functions for creating a new blog post, uploading and retrieving images, and adding comments. Then, we'll create a BlogPage.vue file that utilizes this composable to load and add new blog posts.

-------------------------
I don't want to  think too far ahead but I think this has the potential to work with swarms too (referring to one of your other recent videos). For example, you could have a director agent that hands out task assignments to other 'coder' agents. You could have one agent in charge of the back-end, and one on the front-end. Then you expand it to have an agent in charge of beta testing, one for setting up a web site landing page etc.


The terminal shoudl include a way to stop or force. I expereince when CTRL-C would not owrk. In this case I had to ask to generate the project but some cahnges were lost.

-------------------------

Great job. Really good work. I am using it for hours everyday with ChatGPT-4o-mini and so far it's working well. I have found (with the commercial version as well) is that it takes some time to get to a working stable first iteration for a vue app. The preview screen is sometimes white or there is an error about not loading the vite vue plugin. I found that it helps to ask to add a vue.config.mjs file. 

So my suggestion is to be able to provide a starting project template that is stable and pre-tested. Or it may just be a pre-crafted prompt. These prompts and/or template projects should include best practices and instrtuctions to use the latest versions of node librarires.


​ @ColeMedin Electron is basically a Chromium browser shell within which you can run web content but access the local files etcs ince it is an app. It should be signed with a developer certificate for Macs and also runs on Winodws and Android.) 

If you are going that route you should definitely look at Quasar which can build an Electron app from a Vuejs codebase. I could contribute to this. You can get Bolt to help. It struggles a bit with Quasar CLI but you can install the vite quasar plugin into a regular project ithout too much trouble. (Bolt seems to use Vite by default for web apps) Make sure to tell Bolt to add a vite.cofig.ts/js/mjs file as this seems to help get it working.

-------------------------

Comments: October 29. My aim was investigate whether Bolt can help to generate an Electon app (with Quasar)
Made progress but couldnt get it to successuly build a hyrbrid app that works with both Quasar CLI and vite CLI

Prompt for Electron app
Create a basic app front-end that will be built as a standalone Electron app. 

References:
https://capacitor-community.github.io/electron/docs/gettingstarted
https://quasar.dev/start/vite-plugin/

The objective is to proceed in stages with each stage including some new functionality. 
The app should be usable at the end of each stage. This is stage 1.

Development stack:

Vuejs
Vitejs and vite cli
Javascript
Quasar and Quasar cli
vitejs vue plugin
Quasar Vite plugin
Capacitor and Capacitor cli

Use the <script setup> syntax for scripts

Use these dependencies

"dependencies": {
            "@capacitor-community/electron": "^5.0.1",
 	    "@capacitor/preferences": "^6.0.2" // Optional to suppot saving app and user settings locally

      }
}

Add a src folder containing an App.vue file

include an index.html file as the entry point (Make sure the link to the main.js file is correct
Add a vite.config.mjs file
Add a quasar.config.js file

--------------

FILE: main.js 
(This file is used by vite but should be ignored by Quasar)

import { createApp } from 'vue'
import { Quasar } from 'quasar'
import quasarLang from 'quasar/lang/ja'
import quasarIconSet from 'quasar/icon-set/fontawesome-v6'

// Import icon libraries
import '@quasar/extras/material-icons/material-icons.css'
// ..required because of selected iconSet:
import '@quasar/extras/fontawesome-v6/fontawesome-v6.css'

// Import Quasar css
import 'quasar/src/css/index.sass'

// Assumes your root component is App.vue
// and placed in same folder as main.js
import App from './App.vue'

const myApp = createApp(App)

myApp.use(Quasar, {
  plugins: {}, // import Quasar plugins and add here
  lang: quasarLang,
  iconSet: quasarIconSet,
  /*
  config: {
    brand: {
      // primary: '#e46262',
      // ... or all other brand colors
    },
    notify: {...}, // default set of options for Notify Quasar plugin
    loading: {...}, // default set of options for Loading Quasar plugin
    loadingBar: { ... }, // settings for LoadingBar Quasar plugin
    // ..and many more (check Installation card on each Quasar component/directive/plugin)
  }
  */
})

// Assumes you have a <div id="app"></div> in your index.html
myApp.mount('#app')

-------------------------

Instructions to Run the App
Create a New Directory: Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
Copy the Above Code: Create the files as specified in the artifact above.
Install Dependencies: Run npm install to install all the required packages.

Run the Development Server: Use npm run dev to start the Vite development server.

Launch Electron: In a separate terminal, run npm run electron to launch the Electron app.
This setup will give you a basic Electron app with Vue.js and Quasar, ready for further development in subsequent stages.

-----------

Stage 2 Prompt (Basic app setup 2)

Reference: https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli-webpack/directory-structure/

Minimum is the /quasar.config file (Quasar App Config file), /src/router, /src/layouts, /src/pages and optionally /src/assets

Add a vite.config.mjs file
