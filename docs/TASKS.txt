# Remaining Tasks

#3 Migrate Existing Website (Partially Completed):

Initial setup completed:
âœ… Created appropriate folder structure in the monorepo
âœ… Maintained static site configuration
âœ… Set up initial deployment files

Pending (awaiting blog integration planning):
- Final deployment strategy decision
- Domain and SSL configuration
- Deployment automation setup

See COMPLETED_TASKS.txt for implementation details.

#4 Move Existing apps to Monorepo and integate:

I have existing nodejs projects that I'd like to move to the monorepo. These projects have Express backends and Vue 3 frontends. Help me:

1. Create appropriate folder structure in the monorepo for these projects
2. Identify ways to integrate or share features between the projects
3. Identify key components or feature areas to extract into reusable packages
4. Consider the deployment strategy for the new monorepo
5. Consider a module system for the monorepo (especially backend) so that some features or services can be activated or deactivated as needed

#5 Set Up Analysis API:

Help me create the initial Express API for website analysis:

1. Set up the basic Express server structure
2. Implement the Claude API integration
3. Create the website analysis endpoint
4. Add error handling and logging
5. Set up environment variables

Please include code examples and testing instructions.

#6 Initial Platform Dashboard:

Help me create a basic Vue 3 dashboard that:
1. Shows a list of websites
2. Provides basic analysis controls
3. Displays analysis results
4. Implements basic authentication
5. Connects to the Express backend

Please provide component structure and code examples.

#7 For Incremental Implementation:

I've created the basic project structure. Now help me:

1. Move my existing website into the /apps/marketing directory
2. Update its configuration to work in the monorepo
3. Set up the first API endpoint for website analysis
4. Create a basic test script

Please provide specific steps and code examples, considering the existing project context.

#8 For Testing the Setup:

Help me create a test workflow that:

1. Verifies the monorepo structure is working
2. Tests the website analysis functionality
3. Validates the deployment process
4. Checks environment configurations

Please provide test scripts and validation steps.

#9 Documentation Generation:

For each completed task, generate:

1. Task Documentation:
   - Summary of implementation
   - Key files created/modified
   - Configuration changes
   - Dependencies added

2. Technical Documentation:
   - Architecture decisions
   - API endpoints created
   - Environment variables required
   - Security considerations

3. Next Steps:
   - Immediate next tasks
   - Required improvements
   - Potential issues
   - Dependencies to be added

4. Important Considerations:
   - Security warnings
   - Performance implications
   - Scalability concerns
   - Maintenance requirements

Documentation should be stored in: /docs/tasks/[TASK_NAME]/README.md

Note: After completing each task, use COMPLETED_TASKS.txt to document the implementation details and lessons learned.
