:CONTEXT
I'm building a platform to host and modernize small business websites. The platform will use AI to analyze existing websites and suggest/implement improvements. I'm starting with my own website as a test case.

TECHNICAL STACK:

Frontend: Vue.js 3 + Nuxt
Backend: Node.js + Express
Database: Supabase
Hosting: Fly.io
AI: Claude API integration
Version Control: GitHub

KEY OBJECTIVES:

Analyze existing websites for improvement opportunities
Generate modern, optimized templates
Provide cost-effective hosting ($15-20/month)
Implement automated SSL via Let's Encrypt
Create simple content management interface

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
Copy/web-platform
  /apps
    /platform          # Main management platform
    /clients          # Client websites
    /marketing        # My business website
  /packages
    /core-components  # Shared components
    /themes          # Website templates
  /tools             # Development scripts

-- BEGIN  TASK PROMPTS
You can use this as a base prompt and add specific questions or tasks as needed. For example:
CURRENT TASK:
[Specify the current task you're working on]
Please help me:

Implement the specified task
Suggest best practices and optimizations
Provide code examples and configurations
Identify potential issues and solutions
Recommend next steps

Additional considerations:

Keep code modular and maintainable
Focus on security best practices
Optimize for performance
Consider scalability
Maintain clear documentation

-- END --

After each code change:

1. Analyze modified code files to extract core functionality and patterns
2. Update corresponding prompts in prompts/ directory or prompts.md to reflect current implementation

Skip prompt updates for minor changes (formatting, comments, variable renames).

# Security

## Sensitive Files

DO NOT read or modify:

-   .env files
-   \*_/config/secrets._
-   \*_/_.pem
-   Any file containing API keys, tokens, or credentials

## Security Practices

-   Never commit sensitive files
-   Use environment variables for secrets
-   Keep credentials out of logs and output

# Project Guidelines

## Documentation Requirements

-   Update relevant documentation in /docs when modifying features
-   Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities
-   Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md

## Architecture Decision Records

Create ADRs in /docs/adr for:

-   Major dependency changes
-   Architectural pattern changes
-   New integration patterns
-   Database schema changes
    Follow template in /docs/adr/template.md

## Code Style & Patterns

-   Generate API clients using OpenAPI Generator
-   Use TypeScript axios template
-   Place generated code in /src/generated
-   Prefer composition over inheritance
-   Use repository pattern for data access
-   Follow error handling pattern in /src/utils/errors.ts

## Testing Standards

-   Unit tests required for business logic
-   Integration tests for API endpoints
-   E2E tests for critical user flows
